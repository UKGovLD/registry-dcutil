# registry-deploy-dcutil

This provides vagrant and aws scripts to simplify creation and management of a machine instance for running the Data Conversion utility of the Environment Registry.

## Prerequisites 

Install vagrant (ensure it is 1.4.2 or later):

    http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

Install vagrant aws tools:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
    vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box

Install aws python command line tools:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install awscli
    complete -C aws_completer aws

Install jq:

    http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

For local virtual machines you will also need VirtualBox:

    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

and a Ubuntu box:

    vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

## Creating a local virtual machine instance

    vagrant up local

You can then log into the instance with:

    vagrant ssh local

The http port onto the local instance is mapped to port 4567 on your local machine so pointing a web browser at `http://localhost:4567` should show the launched registry instance.

Destroy it with:

    vagrant destroy local

## Amazon EC2 instances

### AWS credentials

To create an AWS instance you need an appropriate set of credentials.

First create a security group called `Deploy` which provides access to ssh, http and https.

Second ensure you have an installed key pair and a user who has access to that key pair.

Third create a credentials file which can be used to set the shell environment variables needed by the later scripts. This should look like:

	export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
	export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY
	export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1

	export AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME=keyname
	export AWS_SSH_PRIVKEY=/home/user/.ssh/keyname.pem

### Provision an instance

The AWS configuration is designed so that the run time registry information is kept on a separate EBS volume for ease of backup. This complicates the provisioning steps. 

First select or create an EBS volume to use. This might be created from a prior snapshot or might be a brand new volume. Then launch the instance with

    . mycredentials.cred
    vagrant up aws --provider=aws  --no-provision
    ./attach-volume.sh VOLUMEID
    vagrant provision aws

### Tunnel to the instance

For local VM use:

    vagrant ssh local -- -f -L 80:localhost:9080 -N

[Well that's the theory but for me it gives: VM must be created before running this command. Run `vagrant up` first.]

For AWS see tunnel.sh
